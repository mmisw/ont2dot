MMI Ont2Dot ChangeLog

2010-06-22
	- rdfs:Resource range shown as is -- ie., not using "Any" anymore.
	- fixed bug which would prevent the version info from being properly formed when coming
	  from multiple ontologies. Tested with http://sweet.jpl.nasa.gov/1.1/substance.owl
	
2010-06-21
	- jenaInfo._prepareInfoAboutOntology: Use getLexicalForm when getting the version.
	- DotGeneratorJenaImpl._getDataTypePropsLabelSuffixForClass: some ad hoc prefixing, 
	  eg., if range is http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Datatype, then the label
	  for the range is written as rdfs:Datatype.
	  TODO: show associated values in instantiations also embedded in the shape box for
	  instances. 
	
2010-05-23
	- include a "generated by" box with name and version of input ontology.
	
	- added --includeUrls option, which generates URL=entityUri for the entities in the
	  ontology, so the imapx output format can be used with dot.
	  See http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/output.html#d:imap
	
2010-05-22
	- "Any" used as a range (ie., RDFS:Resource) when not explicitly given for a property.
	
	- separateClassHierarchy(String classUri) included:
		Indicates that the class hierarchy rooted at the given class should be
		"separated" for purposes of showing object properties. That is, any object
		property with range in any class in the hierarchy will be indicated in the body
		of the domain class and not with an arrow to the range class, but only when the
		domain class is NOT part of the tree rooted at the range class.
		This helps reduce cluttering of the diagram, especially for common attributes
		used in many classes.
		
	- Options now accepted in the main program. For example:
	    Ont2Dot --separate http://mmisw.org/ont/mmi/device/TypedValue \
	                 http://mmisw.org/ont/mmi/device
	  to indicate a class hierarchy to be "separated" in the diagram.
	  
	- "Globbing" is supported in the --separate argument, eg:
	  http://mmisw.org/ont/mmi/device/{TypedValue,PhysicalProperty,ModelID}
	  is a shorthand for the arguments:
	     http://mmisw.org/ont/mmi/device/TypedValue
	     http://mmisw.org/ont/mmi/device/PhysicalProperty
	     http://mmisw.org/ont/mmi/device/ModelID
	  
	- UnionClass now handled in a preliminary way: a property with domain in a union of
	  classes is now properly dispatched, but only for the operands that are non-anonymous.
	  TODO generic way to handle OwlClass'es (see jena's OntModel.listClasses()).

		
	
2010-04-28
	Initial version. Functional but with parameters not yet fully processed
	nor captured from the command line.
	Self-contained jar can be generated with: mvn assembly:assembly
